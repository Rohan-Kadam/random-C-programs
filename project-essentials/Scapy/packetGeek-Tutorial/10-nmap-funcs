>> TCP Port Range Scanner
==============================
>> This is a fairly basic tool to test whether a host has specific TCP ports open and listening. 

>> We start out by defining our host and ports to scan and then move on to the fun stuff. Using a random TCP source port to help obfuscate the attack (although most firewalls are smarter than this nowadays), we send a TCP SYN packet to each destination TCP port specified. 

1>> If we get no response or a TCP RST in return, we know that the host is filtering or not listening on that port. 
2>> If we get an ICMP unreachable or error response, we also know the host is not willing to take requests on that port. 
3>> But, if we get an expected TCP SYN/ACK response, we will send a RST so the host doesnâ€™t keep listening for our ACK since we already know the host is listening on that port.



>> ICMP Ping Sweep
==============================
>> This script is an extension of our ICMP ping utility from the Sending and Receiving example. Remember to provide correct CIDR

1>> If the response times out or returns an ICMP error (such as unreachable or admin deny), we know that the host is not up or is blocking ICMP
2>> But, if we receive a response we know that host is online

>> NOTE: This could certainly be made much faster with threading since this is mostly IO bound (waiting for network responses)

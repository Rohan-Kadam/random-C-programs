>> We’ve sniffed some packets, dig down into packet layers and fields, and even sent some packets. Great job! It’s time to step up our game with Scapy and start really using some of the power Scapy contains. Please Note: this next example is for education and example only. Please be responsible on your network, especially at work!

>> Send and Recv funcs
sr  : send/recv L3 pkt 
sr1 : send/recv L3 pkt once

srp1: send/recv L2 pkt once

>> Sending an ICMP Echo Request (ping), first lets sniff 1 ICMP packet and see its fields
p = sniff(count=10,filter="icmp and ip host 192.168.0.5")

>> Now lets generate ICMP packet. Since we’re building a L3 packet, we can actually leave off the Ether layer since Scapy will handle the generation of that.

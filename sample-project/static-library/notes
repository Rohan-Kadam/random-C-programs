Followed geeks4geeks tutorial. Downloaded the html page of the same.

Used archivers to create .a file

Tested: gcc direct. since src had #include "lib_mylib.h" and header file is in same directory
Result: FAIL
		/tmp/ccAlOJMO.o: In function `main':
		driver.c:(.text+0x5): undefined reference to `fun'
		collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status

		Since header didn't had defination of function called in src.

Tested: Changed lib function
Result: Change reflected only after compiling(gcc -c. Creates .o file, no executable) lib_mylib.c, re-creating its .a file and complete compiling (gcc. Creates executable directly) src with -L

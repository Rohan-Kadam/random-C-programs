=======================================================================================================

buffer.txt: 
Used by inotify and inotify_udp code to buffer mac addresses				 

casino.cpp: 
Head first C example

dnotify.c: 
generates notification signal if changes done in directory which was under observation

inotify.c: 
generates notification signal if changes done in file which was under observation

inotify_udp.c: 
same as above code, but added udp socket to it.

linkedlist.c: 
simple linkedlist data structure implementation

modify_string_literals_using_malloc.c: 
char* modification using malloc.

FIFO-namedpipe-to-file.c: 
capture stdout to pipe and store it in file [INCOMPLETE]

signal_for_early_wakeup_sent_to_thread_SIGALRM.c
Wakeups the sleeping thread by firing SIGALRM using pthread_kill.
Custom signal handler registered.

signal_for_terminating_thread_SIGSEGV.c
Terminates thread form main thread using SIGSEGV signal.
Custom signal handler registered.

ptrmem_arrmem_compare.c:
printing memory address of array[STACK] and pointer[RO-DATA]

modify_rodata_NOT_POSSIBLE.cpp
trying to modify rodata, directly and by using pointer
Conclusion: Cannot modify ro-data

DS_stack.c:
simple stack implementation

DS_linkedlist.c:
simple link list implementation

FIFO-stdout-to-pipe.c:
capture stdout to pipe

FIFO-stdout-to-pipe-to-string.c:
capture stdout to pipe and convert to string

strtok.c:
testing strtok function

struct_functioncall.cpp:
testing simple C structure 

struct_simple.cpp:
testing simple C structure

increase_mem_util.c
malloc + memset, increases memory utilization

increase_cpu_util.c
Cal prime number, increases cpu utilization

CircularQueue_ProdConsThrd_PoissonDistributionInput.c
exchange data between producer and consumer over circular buffer. Producer generate data as per Poisson Distribution delay

casino_switch_case.cpp
Simple switch case implementation

DS_vector.cpp
Using C++ STL vector data structure

4bit_bitmask.c
Update bit value of only certain bits, retaining old bit values in remaining bits.
eg: char abc = xxxx xyyy
To update only yyy bits, use 0x07 Mask and to retain old value in xxx bits use complementary mask

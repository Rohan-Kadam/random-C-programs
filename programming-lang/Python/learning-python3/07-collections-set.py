# COLLECTIONS : Set {}
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# There are four collection data types in the Python programming language:

#    List is a collection which is ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members.
#    Tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members.
#    Set is a collection which is unordered and unindexed. No duplicate members.
#    Dictionary is a collection which is unordered, changeable and indexed. No duplicate members.

my_set = {1.0, "Hello", (1, 2, 3)}
print(my_set)

#Built-in set method
#add()	                            Adds an element to the set
#clear()	                    Removes all the elements from the set
#copy()	                            Returns a copy of the set
#difference()	                    Returns a set containing the difference between two or more sets
#difference_update()	            Removes the items in this set that are also included in another, specified set
#discard()	                    Remove the specified item
#intersection()	                    Returns a set, that is the intersection of two other sets
#intersection_update()	            Removes the items in this set that are not present in other, specified set(s)
#isdisjoint()	                    Returns whether two sets have a intersection or not
#issubset()	                    Returns whether another set contains this set or not
#issuperset()	                    Returns whether this set contains another set or not
#pop()	                            Removes an element from the set
#remove()	                    Removes the specified element
#symmetric_difference()	            Returns a set with the symmetric differences of two sets
#symmetric_difference_update()	    inserts the symmetric differences from this set and another
#union()	                    Return a set containing the union of sets
#update()	                    Update the set with the union of this set and others

/*
 * Constructor vs Member Functions
 *
1) Constructor doesnâ€™t have a return type. Member function has a return type.
2) Constructor is automatically called when we create the object of the class. Member function needs to be called explicitly using object of class.
3) When we do not create any constructor in our class, C++ compiler generates a default constructor and insert it into our code. The same does not apply to member functions.
